Flux Lance
==========

The Spatial Flux Lance generator creates a short-lived spatial distortion in proximity outside the ship. The distortion is deadly to fighters and a nuisance for armoured ships.
The lance has a spear-head/water-drop shaped nozzle. The nozzle starts disconnected from the border with a semi-circle. It stops stops at 3/4 of the picture to hint at the weapon's short range.
